# Introduction
Hypercube_Evolution_MGN12H embraces the Hypercube Evolution design philosophy of being a CoreXY printer using 30x30mm aluminum extrusions for the mainframe and the components being tucked in the sides to make it easily enclosed. But improves upon the rigidity by using MGN12H liner rails in conjunction with thicker 3D printed components.

This design is a motion and execution platform for a 3D printer. Components like the motherboard, build plate, LED lights, HEPA filters, etc. are for the individual builder to determine. A calculator will calculate the length of components to accommodate various print volumes and rail lengths.

Shout out to the people in the "[Hypercube Evolution Pro modified](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hevopro/)" Facebook group for helping me designing this printer.
